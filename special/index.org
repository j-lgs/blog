This site's intention is to document projects I have made, skill I have learnt and to share the interesting projects others have made. The hope is that documenting my projects will help myself in improving them, and help others to learn something new.

The primary topics this site will focus on are Linux, conatiner technologies, the Kubernetes ecosystem, networking in the home and cloud.
